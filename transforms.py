# Data does not always come in its final processed form that is required for training machine learning algorithms. We use transforms to perform some manipulation of the data and make it suitable for training.

# ToTensor converts a PIL image or NumPy ndarray into a FloatTensor. and scales the imageâ€™s pixel intensity values in the range [0., 1.]

# Lambda transforms apply any user-defined lambda function. Here, we define a function to turn the integer into a one-hot encoded tensor.
# It first creates a zero tensor of size 10 (the number of labels in our dataset) and calls scatter_ which assigns a value=1 on the index as given by the label y.
